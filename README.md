# Microsoft Security Data eXchange - MSDX
Your platform for extracting and shipping security value from your data lake to Sentinel. 

Security thrives when you don't have to choose between dropping your logs and dropping your budget. Large models make your data more valuable, and your insights more reachable than ever before. Ingest and store your data into a data lake at a fraction of the cost of the SIEM, while unlocking security insights that were complete gaps prior.

MSDX is designed to sift through your lake and find security gold. We do this by summarizing the data, and only returning the summarized data to Sentinel. Your SIEM now has highly concentrated information which it can use for OoB Rules (MSDX functions), and workbooks for quick visualization and hunting (MSDX Workbooks).
